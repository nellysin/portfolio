<h1>Nelly Sin</h1>

<p>Hi! My name is Nelly and I go to Galileo High School as an incoming junior. I live with my mom, dad, and an older sister in San Francisco. I was born and raised in the bay area and lived in SF my entire 16 years. I'm interested in computer science so I joined Girls Who Code!</p>

<p> In my free time I enjoy reading web comics. It's interesting and it's addicting. There are many artists and many genres and story lines.</p>

<p> I LOVE HAMILTON! It's my first musical I'm interested and I started to be interested in more musicals because of it. I listen and sing along to the music daily. This musical is unique mixing rap and U.S history along fits this musical well.
