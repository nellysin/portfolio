<p class="one"> I did not know how the "piezo" worked and what it did. I thought the piezo was pretty hard to understand. But it quick to learn.</p>

<p class="one"> My favorite out dance routine was when our robo baby spun around.</p>

	<h1> Data </h1>

<p class ="one"> Computers are good with data becuase they are able to store a lot of information in it.</p>
<p class = "one"> My data scientist I researched was Ursula Endlicher, and  it's interesting how she is able to turn data into an art form</p>
	
	<h1> Algorithms </h1>
	
	<p> 7/11/2017 </p>
	
<p class= "one"> I am proud of learning more about algorithms in computer science. Such as, how the internet works with algorithms </p>
2. I think the web search was the most interesting algorithm that was presented and it was unique how the spider "crawls" from one page to another</p>
3. Each was a important piece to the programming branch. And some were for security reasons for animations , and etc.</p>

	<h1> OOP (Object Oriented Program) </h1>
	
	<p> 7/12/17 </p>
	
<p class ="one"> 1. It makes it less time consuming and it makes the person code less and more seperated and clear. But it's it's hard to explain 
	2. How to use the return statement in the networking program and making dictionaries where and when we were suppose to.
	 Anstonia's comments made it easier what to type in the functions.</p>
